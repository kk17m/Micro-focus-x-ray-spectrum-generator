# Micro-focus-x-ray-spectrum-generator
A reference x-ray spectrum generator for a microfocus source with tungsten-anode spectral model using interpolating polynomials (TASMIP). 

## Description

This spectrum generator can be used to simulate x-ray beam transmission properties for different maximum excitation energies and different beam filteration elements. The transmission properties are modelled using the Beer-Lambert attenuation law for parallel beam geometry. 


### Future Extensions

* Addition of data tables for different x-ray tubes. 

* Addition of cone beam attenuation geometry.
